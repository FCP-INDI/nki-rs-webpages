Trauma Symptom Checklist for Adults (TSC-40)
--------------------------------------------
The TSC-40 is a 40-item self-report that evaluates symptomology in adults (ages 18 and older) associated with childhood or adult traumatic experiences. The TSC-40 consists of six subscales: Anxiety, Depression, Dissociation, Sexual Abuse Trauma Index (SATI), Sexual Problems, and Sleep Disturbance, and includes a Total Score as well. Each symptom item is rated according to it’s frequency of occurrence over the past two months using a 4-point scale: 0-Never, to 3-Often.
