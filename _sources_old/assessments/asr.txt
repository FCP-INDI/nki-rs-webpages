Adult Self Report (ASR)
-----------------------
The ASR is a 126-item self-report questionnaire for adults (ages 18–59) assessing aspects of adaptive functioning and problems. The questionnaire provides scores for the following syndrome scales: anxious/depressed, withdrawn, somatic complaints, thought problems, attention problems, aggressive behavior, rule-breaking behavior, and intrusive behavior. The questionnaire provides scores for the following DSM-oriented scales: depressive problems, anxiety problems, somatic problems, avoidant personality problems, attention deficit/ hyperactivity problems (inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity subscales), and antisocial personality problems. Additionally, the questionnaire asks about use of the following substances: tobacco, alcohol, and drugs. Items are rated on a 3-point scale: 0-Not True, 1-Somewhat or Sometimes True, 2-Very True or Often True.
