Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire (EHQ) – modified by Mark Cohen in 2008
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire is a measurement scale used to assess the dominance of a person's right or left hand in everyday activities. The inventory can be used by an observer assessing the person, or by a person self-reporting hand use. The EHQ includes a list of activities, and asks the participant to indicate “which hand you prefer for that activity?” and “do you ever use the other hand for that activity?” This questionnaire was updated by Mark Cohen in 2008, and is adapted from Oldfield, 1971 – see Publication.
