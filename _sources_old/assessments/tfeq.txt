Three-Factor Eating (TFEQ)
--------------------------
The TFEQ is a 51-item self-report questionnaire designed for adolescents and adults (ages 12 and up). This assessment is designed to measure 3 dimensions of human eating behavior: cognitive restraint of eating (Factor I - 20 items), disinhibition (Factor II – 16 items), and hunger (Factor III - 15 items). The minimum score for factors I-II-III is therefore 0-0-0, and maximum possible score is 20-16-15. Part I includes items 1-36 and are rated either 1-True or 0-False. Part II includes items 37-51 and is rated on a 4-point scale with the exception of item 50, which is rated on a 6-point scale.
