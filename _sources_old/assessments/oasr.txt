Older Adult Self Report (OASR)
------------------------------
The OASR is a 127-item self-administered instrument designed for older adults (ages 60-90) that examines diverse aspects of adaptive functioning and problems. Participants are asked to review a list of items that describe people, and select the best answer to describe themselves over the past two months on a 3-point scale: 0-Not true, 1-Somewhat or Sometimes True, 2-Very True or Often True. The questionnaire provides scores for the following syndrome scales: anxious/depressed, worries, somatic complaints, functional impairment, memory/cognition problems, thought problems, and irritable/disinhibited. The questionnaire provides scores for the following DSM-oriented scales: depressive problems, anxiety problems, somatic problems, dementia problems, psychotic problems, and antisocial personality problems. Additionally, the questionnaire asks about their use of tobacco, alcohol, and drugs.
