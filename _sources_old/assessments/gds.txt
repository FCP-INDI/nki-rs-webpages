Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)
--------------------------------
The GDS is a 30-item self-report assessment used to identify depression in the elderly.  The participant is asked to respond “Yes” or “No” to a series of questions about how they have felt over the past week. This instrument may be used with healthy, medically ill, or mild to moderately cognitively impaired older adults.
