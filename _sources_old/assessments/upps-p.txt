UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale
-------------------------------
The UPPS-P is a 59-item self-report that assesses five subscales (urgency, premeditation, perseverance, sensation seeking, and positive urgency) that are used to measure five distinct dimensions of impulse behavior in adolescents and adults (ages 12 and older). It is designed to measure impulsivity across dimensions of the Four Factor Model of personality: Premeditation (lack of), Urgency, Sensation Seeking, Perseverance (lack of). 

The Scale is not considered a measure of trait impulsivity, rather, the scales reflect distinct personality traits that lead to impulsive-type behavior. Participants are asked to consider acts/incidents during the last 6 months when rating their behavior and attitudes on a 4-point scale, in which 1-Agree strongly, 2-Agree some, 3-Disagree some, 4-Disagree strongly.
