Assessments
------------

The battery for NKI-RS was constructed based on discussions with
assessment developers, expert consultants, and a formal presentation to
the Child Mind Institute’s Scientific Research Council (SRC). We
prioritized inclusion of empirically validated measures in the public
domain, as those are most amenable to widespread adoption in other
studies. Additionally, we prioritized use of measures that could be
administered and compared across the lifespan. In attempting to serve as
a resource for future studies, the NKI-RS compares commonly used
assessments that measure the same construct, behavior, or disorder. We
also compare proprietary and non-proprietary assessments [e.g., the
Conners ADHD Scales (Conners et al., 1997; Conners, 1999) versus
Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD-Symptoms and Normal-Behavior Scale
(SWAN; Hay et al., 2007)], and can assess the construct validity of
different assessments [e.g., the Computerized Neurocognitive Battery
(Gur et al., 2001) versus the Delis–Kaplan Executive Functioning System
(Delis et al., 2004)].

Our approach, similar to that of the Brain Genomics Superstruct (Yeo et
al., 2011), differs from the more common model of centering
collaborative efforts on a particular disorder or set of disorders,
which can limit the applicability of a comparison sample. Given the
current focus on developing a dimensional framework for psychiatric
illnesses and patterns of comorbidity (Chabernaud et al., 2012), we
adopted broad phenotypic characterization for NKI-RS. By employing a
common protocol that covers a wide array of domains of psychiatric,
cognitive, and behavioral functions, we can make direct comparisons
between psychiatric illnesses and increase the feasibility of
determining overlap and distinctions among their neural correlates.
