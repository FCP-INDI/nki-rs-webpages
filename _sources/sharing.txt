How to Access NKI-RS Data
--------------------------

It is our goal to provide researchers with the greatest flexibility to carry out scientific inquiries using the NKI-Rockland data. In this regard: 

* We do not require authorship on any manuscripts generated using NKI-Rockland data; citation as a data-source is sufficient.
* We do not require review of manuscripts generated using NKI-Rockland datasets; though we do strongly encourage careful documentation of any selection criteria applied to the NKI-RS in choosing datasets for your analysis.
* We do not require specification of planned data analyses prior to data access.

**Protection of participant privacy is our first and primary concern.**

Given the high dimensionality and personal nature of the data included (e.g., psychiatric assessments), we have developed two release versions: 

**NKI-RS Lite Release:**

* Contains imaging data, physiological data acquired during scan acquisition (cardiac and respiratory), and limited phenotyping (age, sex, and handedness).
* No psychiatric, cognitive, or behavioral information is included.
* Immediately available to users (does not require a data usage agreement)

**NKI-RS Full Phenotypic Release:**

* Contains data for the high-dimensional phenotypic protocol. (See the :doc:`Assessments Page <assessments>` for more information, or contact `Michael Milham <mailto:MMilham@NKI.RFMH.org>`_)

    * DSM-IV based psychiatric diagnostic assessment.
    * Dimensional psychiatric and behavioral assessment questionnaires (item-level responses included).
    * Neuropsychological testing.
    * Cognitive/behavioral performance measures.
    * Basic laboratory measures.
    * Actigraphy (for a minimum 1 night of sleep).

* Data Usage agreement is required.

    * Expected completion time: < 5 minutes
    * Signature and notarization by appropriate institutional representative is required.
