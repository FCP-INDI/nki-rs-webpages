Participant Schedule
---------------------

During review of the finalized phenotyping protocol, a 2-day schedule format was developed. This 2-day format addressed concerns that the comprehensiveness of the phenotyping protocol would be unduly burdensome to both participants and experimenters if condensed into a single day.  This would potentially endanger its effectiveness due to factors such as fatigue. 

As the data collection efforts continued, we determined that the full 2-day format reduced the likelihood of full participation.  In response to this concern, an abridged schedule was developed and implemented in September 2015.  Both schedules are listed below:
