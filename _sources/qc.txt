Data Quality
------------

The `Brain Connectivity and Cognition Laboratory <http://www.psy.miami.edu/bccl/>`_ at the University of Miami has performed a quality check on a subset of the Rockland Sample data.  Four trained undergraduates supervised by Dina Dajani and Paola Odriozola checked 176 subjects between the ages of 8 and 50.

MPRAGE and 1400 ms TR resting-state scans from the first visit were categorized as *passing*, *qualified passing (QP)*, or *failing*.  *Passing* data does not have any issues.  *QP data* for structural images is defined as data usable for coregistration but not for structural studies. *QP data* for resting-state data can mean that one of several issues (e.g., motion slice, superior coverage issues) were noted both as one-word and detailed comments. *Failing* data is unusable.  For any resting-state images with motion slice issues that are not considered failing, the offending slices are noted and a second rater has double-checked that volumes are correct.   More detailed information about how these categories are defined can be found `here <_static/Miami_QCScoringGuidelines.doc>`_.

The results of this quality check can be found in the spreadsheet available `here <_static/Miami_QC.csv>`_.
