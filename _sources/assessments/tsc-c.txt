Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSC-C)
---------------------------------------------
The TSC-C is a 54-item self-report inventory assessing posttraumatic stress in children (ages 8 -17) who have experienced traumatic events such as physical or sexual abuse, major loss, natural disaster, or violence. The following clinical scales are assessed: Anxiety, Depression, Anger, Posttraumatic Stress, Dissociation, and Sexual Concerns. Child participants are asked to rate the frequency of certain thoughts and behaviors on a 4-point scale: 0-Never 1-Sometimes, 2-Lots of the time, 3-Almost all the time.
