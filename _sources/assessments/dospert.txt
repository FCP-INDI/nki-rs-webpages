The Domain-Specific Risk-Taking Scale (DOSPERT)
-----------------------------------------------
The DOSPERT is a 90-item self-report that assesses risk taking in five content domains: financial decisions (separately for investing versus gambling), health/safety, recreational, ethical, and social decisions. First, participants rate the likelihood that they would engage in domain-specific risky activities on a 7-point scale: 1-Extremely unlikely, 2-Moderately unlikely, 3-Somewhat unlikely, 4-Not sure, 5-Somewhat likely, 6-Moderately likely, 7-Extremely Likely. Next, participants rate the perceived riskiness of these activities on a 7-point scale: 1-Not at all risky, 2-Sligthly risky, 3-Somewhat risky, 4-Moderately risky, 5-Risky, 6-Very risky, 7-Extremely risky. Finally, participants rate the expected benefits of each activity on a 7-point scale: 1-No benefits at all, 4-Moderate benefits, 7-Great benefits.
