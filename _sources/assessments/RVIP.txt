RVIP Assessment
----------------

The rapid visual information processing task measures sustained attention ability as well as working memory. The task is administered using custom software that conforms to literature describing its original implementation in the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB; see Sahakian & Owen, 1992). As a behavioral task, the RVIP provides a number of possible outcome measures. In the release, the following variables will be provided: Total targets, Hits, Misses, false alarms, mean rate, hit rate, false alarm rate, A’ (A’ is an alternative to the more common d’ in signal detection theory, both of which reflect a ratio of hits to false alarms; for more details see e.g., Stanislaw & Todorov, 1999).
