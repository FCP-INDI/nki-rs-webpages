Short Imaginal Process Inventory (SIPI)
----------------------------------------

The SIPI is a 45-item, self-administered, Likert scale questionnaire
designed to measure aspects of daydreaming style and content, mental
style, and general inner experience. Items are rated on a five-point
scale: 1-Very true or strongly characteristic of me, 2-Moderately true
or characteristic of me, 3-Neither particularly characteristic nor
uncharacteristic of me, 4-Moderately untrue or uncharacteristic of me,
5-Definitely untrue or strongly uncharacteristic of me.
