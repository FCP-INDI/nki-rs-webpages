Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ)
-----------------------------------------

The ERQ is a 10-item, self-administered, Likert scale questionnaire for
adults that is designed to assess individual differences in the habitual
use of two emotion regulation strategies: cognitive reappraisal and
expressive suppression. Items are rated on a seven point scale:
1-Strongly Disagree, 4-Neutral, 7-Strongly Agree. The questionnaire
provides scores for reappraisal and suppression.
