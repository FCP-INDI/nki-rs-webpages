Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ)
-------------------------------------------

The PTQ is a self-administered, 15-item, Likert-type scale designed to
measure the broad idea of repetitive negative thought. The items on the
scale assess what are considered to be the core aspects of repetitive
negative thought: 1) their repetitive and intrusive nature, 2) the
perceived unproductive nature of these thoughts, and 3) the way in which
this type of thinking captures mental capacity. Items are rated on a
five-point scale: 0-Never, 1-Rarely, 2-Sometimes, 3-Often, 4-Almost
Always.
