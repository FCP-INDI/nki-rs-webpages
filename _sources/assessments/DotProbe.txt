Dot Probe
----------

In this task, a pair of faces, one threat-related and one either neutral
or happy, are shown briefly side-by-side. A small probe replaces one of
the faces immediately following offset. Participants are then required
to respond as quickly as possible by pressing keys on a keyboard to
indicate which face was replaced by a dot without compromising accuracy.
The face stimuli are usually photographs of 16 different individuals (8
male, 8 female) taken from the NimStim set.
