Youth Self-Report (YSR)
-----------------------
The YSR is a 112-item self-report designed for children and adolescents (ages 11-17), that assesses behavioral competency and behavioral problems and parallels the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Behaviors are rated on a 3-point scale: 0-Not true, 1-Somewhat or sometimes true and 2-Very true or often true, based on the preceding 6-months. The questionnaire provides scores for the following syndrome scales: anxious/depressed, withdrawn/depressed, somatic complains, social problems, thought problems, rule-breaking behavior, and aggressive behavior. The questionnaire provides scores for the following DSM-oriented scales: affective problems, anxiety problems, somatic problems, attention deficit/hyperactivity problems, oppositional defiant problems, and conduct problems. There are 20 social competency items that measure the childâ€™s participation in hobbies, games, sports, jobs, chores, friendship, and activities.
