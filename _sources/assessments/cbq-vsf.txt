The Children’s Behavior Questionnaire (Very Short Form) – (CBQ-VSF)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The CBQ-VSF is a 36-item informant-report questionnaire assessing temperament of children (ages 3 – 8).  The questionnaire is designed to capture three broad dimensions: surgency/extraversion, negative affectivity, and effortful control. Informants are asked to rate their child based on how they feel that their child’s reaction is likely to be in a variety of situations. Responses are given on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (extremely untrue of my child) to 7 (extremely true of my child).  The questionnaire is designed to capture three broad dimensions: surgency/extraversion, negative affectivity, and effortful control. Participants are asked to rate how well the items describe their child on a 7-point scale: 1-extremely untrue of my child, 2-quite untrue, 3- slightly untrue, 4-neither true nor untrue, 5-slightly true, 6-quite true, 7-extremely true of my child.
