State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)
------------------------------------
The STAI is a 40-Item self-report questionnaire designed to evaluate anxiety in adults (18 years and older).  A version exists for children as well. It is analysis of reported anxiety symptoms and is divided into two sections, each with twenty questions.  The first subscale measures state anxiety, the second measures trait anxiety. Both use ratings on a 4-point scale: 1-Almost never, 2-Sometimes, 3-Often, 4-Almost always. Higher score reflects greater symptomatology of anxiety.
