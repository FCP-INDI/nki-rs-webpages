Tanner
------
The Tanner scale is administered to children and adolescents to assess sexual maturity or pubertal development.Â There are two components of Tanner staging described for each sex, rated separately on a scale of one to five, where stage one is pre-puberty and stage five is adult maturity. For girls, staging is based on breast maturation and pubic hair growth, while for boys it is based on penis and testes development and pubic hair growth.
