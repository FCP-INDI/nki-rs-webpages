GUR/ Penn CNP
--------------

The GUR Neurocognitive Battery is a computerized battery that takes an average of one hour to complete and provides measures of accuracy and speed in nine neurocognitive domains: abstraction/flexibility, attention, working memory, episodic memory, language, spatial, sensorimotor, motor speed, and emotion identification. 

**Domains Assessed:** :doc:`Cognitive Function <cognitive>`,
:doc:`Attention <attention>`, Abstraction/Flexibility, Working
Memory, Episodic Memory, Language, Spatial, Sensorimotor, Motor Speed,
and Emotion Identification.

**Note:** The GUR/Penn CNP is administered to children and adults ages
6-85 years old.
