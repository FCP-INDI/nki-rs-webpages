Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT)
------------------------------------------

The RAVLT evaluates verbal learning and memory. The examiner reads aloud
a list of 15 words at the rate of one per second. The participant is
then asked to repeat all words from the list that he/she can remember.
This procedure is carried out a total of five times. The examiner then
presents a second list of 15 words, allowing the participant only one
attempt at recall of this new list. Immediately following this, the
participant is asked to remember as many words as possible from the
first list. After a 20-minute delay, the participant is again asked to
recall as many words as possible from the first list. The participant is
then read a list of words and asked to indicate whether each word was
from the first list. The RAVLT has proven useful in evaluating verbal
learning and memory, including proactive inhibition, retroactive
inhibition, retention, encoding versus retrieval, and subjective
organization.
