The Behavioral Indicator of Resiliency to Distress (BIRD)
----------------------------------------------------------

The participant is presented with a screen that shows a bird inside of a
birdcage and ten numbered boxes in a row. A green dot randomly moves
above the boxes. The participantâ€™s goal is to click on the numbered box
below the green dot, before the dot moves. Subjects hear a pleasant
sound and are awarded points each time they succeed in doing this.
However, an unpleasant sound is played whenever the subjects do not
click the box in time. Subjects can press a button to abort the game.

years old.
