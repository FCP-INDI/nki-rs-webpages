Study Visit Codes
==================

Visit codes are also more informative for data collection and organization for upload.   The longitudinal information will be better handled with the addition of a time-lag variable for assessments that we hope to include in the future.

* V1      - code for the first day of testing when we had two days of testing for our core battery
* V2     - code for the second day of testing when we had two days of testing for our core battery
* VA     - code for the one day of testing when we shifted from two days of data collection to one day for our core battery
* VA_ALG  – code for the one day of testing (adult longitudinal fitness study), same as VA just with ALG because needed for data entry
* V2REP   - participant has a baseline cross-sectional visit (V2) and then came back some period of time later and repeated (REP) the visit (V2) – we coded those visits (V2REP)
* VA-REP  participant has a baseline cross-sectional visit (VA) and then came back some period of time later and repeated (REP) the visit (VA) – we coded those visits (VA-REP)
* V4     - child longitudinal study 12-15month follow-up appointment
* V5        - child longitudinal study 24-30 month follow-up appointment
