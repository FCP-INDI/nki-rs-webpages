The NKI-RS data uses the following coding convention to differentiate between data acquisition sessions:

Study Codes

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Code (COINS)", "Code (NITRC/AWS)","Description"
    :widths: 5,5,40
    :file: _static/visit_codes.csv

Visit Codes
-----------

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Code (COINS)", "Code (NITRC/AWS)","Description"
    :widths: 5,5,40
    :file: _static/study_codes.csv

Note that in the real-time neurofeedback study, 'R' signifies a re-visit, while in the longitudinal developmental connectomics study, it represents a re-test.
